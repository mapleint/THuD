## THuD
THuD (The Hell u Doing) is a Windows activity tracker, to see what you spend your time focused on. I am making this for myself so I can ridicule myself for having bad habits.  

ThuD:
 - Records what you look at and for how long 
 - Doesn't store too invasive logs (all is local anyways)
 - has very low RAM and CPU usage
 - ~~get you a cute north korean gf~~

map in C was made by [RXI](github.com/rxi), if anyone reading is an afformentioned cute north korean girl, contact him first as he is a legend amongst men. Of course, I wrote all in main.cpp, and that shows the 30 IQ I have when I wrote this eating BEANS. If you have any contributions or ports to other platforms, you may raise an issue.
